<p>Now your phone could save your life.</p>
<p>Traumalert is a new application that will use your phone to automatically contact your loved ones when you need it, such as after a fall or car accident. It is especially useful if you become unconscious or are unable to reach or dial your phone after your accident.</p>
<p>Traumalert works by using the motion detectors in your phone to sense when you are undergoing high acceleration, signifying a traumatic event. When this happens, a count down will occur, and after a set amount of time if you do not cancel the count down it will dial your preset contacts, letting them know of your situation and location.</p>
<p>Thank you for using Traumalert. With Traumalert, you will never be alone in times of need.</p>
